### description
Therapi is a password-protected diary with a minimalist interface where users are able to process their feelings and emotions. We plan to include 3 different journal templates for users to choose from. Firstly, we have a blank page template where the user has the freedom to write whatever they want. Secondly, we want to have a “quick journal” page that lets the user fill in the ‘highs’ and ‘lows’ of their day and what they’re looking forward to. Lastly, we would like to implement a “prompt” template where the user is given a random prompt and writes about it. Once the user is done, they can lock the diary and access their entries later with the right password.
